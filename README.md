## Music Recommender System

## Overview

The **Music Recommender System** is a web application that suggests personalized music based on your input. This system leverages Spotifyâ€™s extensive music library to recommend tracks similar to the one you choose. It provides an intuitive and interactive interface for users to discover new music tailored to their preferences.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get song suggestions based on your selected track.
- **Album Covers**: Display of album covers for each recommended song.
- **Direct Links to Spotify**: Click on any recommended song poster to be redirected to its Spotify page.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit
- Spotipy (for Spotify API interaction)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install the libraries manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit spotipy pandas scikit-learn
```

### 3. Set Up Spotify API Credentials

Create an account and register your application on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

Once you have your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, add them to the code (or securely store them using environment variables).

```python
CLIENT_ID = "<your-client-id>"
CLIENT_SECRET = "<your-client-secret>"
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Streamlit app by running:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the app in your default browser, where you can interact with the music recommender system.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Song**: Use the dropdown to choose a song.
2. **Get Recommendations**: Click the "Show Recommendation" button to see music suggestions.
3. **Explore More**: Click on any of the album covers to open the song directly on Spotify.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A fast and easy framework for creating web apps.
- **Spotipy**: A Python library for interacting with the Spotify API.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and storage.
- **Scikit-learn**: For calculating cosine similarity between songs based on their features.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Recommendation Algorithms**: Implementing machine learning models for better recommendations.
- **Song Preview**: Adding song previews in the app so users can listen before they visit Spotify.

## Acknowledgements

- **Spotify API**: For providing access to millions of songs and their metadata.
- **Streamlit**: For enabling rapid prototyping of web applications.
